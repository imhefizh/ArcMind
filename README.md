### Welcome

Free to Read. Here's my own LaTex Journals for everything I learned. Straight forward to go to these fields:

- Database Engineering
- AI Engineering
- Mathematics for Engineers
- Entrepreneurship

Update:

1. I've done the rough notes for Entrepreneurship, but I still think to rephrase it to make it easier to understand. Gon do that later.
2. I'm working on Database Engineering rn.
3. I was using Obsidian as my note-app, but I decided to use LaTex instead. Some of the notes have not been migrated yet.
